# AntiTwitter

A firefox extension for all your AntiTwitter related needs.

Package it: https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/package-your-extension/ (if you get a corruption error, it's not my fault)

This extension is disabled when #elon is appended to the URL or the URL is not a twitter URL.
